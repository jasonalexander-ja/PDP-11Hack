# PDP-11/HACK

Based on [PDP-11/HACK](http://madrona.ca/e/pdp11hack/index.html) by Brent Hilpert. A simple UART interfaced single board computer based on the DEC J11, a microprocessor implementation of the DEC PDP-11. 

This is a repository for all the code and schematics for my attempt at recreating this.
